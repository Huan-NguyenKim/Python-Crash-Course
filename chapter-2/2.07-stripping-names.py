#2-7. Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a personâ€™s name, and include
#some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure
#you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.

#Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
#Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(),
#rstrip(), and strip().

name = "\tHuan Nguyen\n"
print("\nNot using any methods")
print(name)

print("\nUsing the lstrip method")
print(name.lstrip())

print("\nUsing the rstrip method")
print(name.rstrip())

print("\nUsing the strip method")
print(name.strip())
